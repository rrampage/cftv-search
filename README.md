### A Local Search UI for Cloudflare.tv

Currently, searching for previous videos on Cloudflare.tv is difficult. This project is a proof of concept which uses [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) to index and search previously uploaded videos. The data was fetched using the API from Schedule page.

#### TODO:
This site is not yet working correctly on mobile devices and is definitely not responsive.
