Learn how a seemingly \"\"\"\"client side\"\"\"\" language graduated to powering one of the largest edge networks in the world.\n\nLearn a few ways to integrate serverless into your web applications today. In the spirit of spreading knowledge this presentation will go over a demo for supporting internationalization and translations on your site as well as A/B testing and optimizing for mobile.
