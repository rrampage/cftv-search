Today, visually impaired users can only provide feedback with a developed application that is compatible with a screen reader. By that time, many changes would require code refactoring, which would increase company expenses and delay improvements.

But what does it mean to be delightfully accessible instead of hitting the benchmark of accessibility best practices?\n\nFurthermore, how can we better incorporate accessibility into the design process and enable those with visual impairments to provide feedback earlier? Today, visually impaired users can only provide feedback with a developed application that is compatible with a screen reader. By that time, many changes would require code refactoring, which would increase company expenses and delay improvements. Excluding valuable input from vision impaired users, a group of almost 300 million people, due to technical limitations is unacceptable and can be mitigated by the process we have developed through Design Thinking.","tags":["Design Thinking","Design"],"title":"Designing for Accessibility with Accessibility in Mind","id":"6MavGZwpMIrlO8hjWl7b7C","videoId":"67eaddf71668683e5f856793debee904"},{"start":"2020-08-24T23:00:00.000Z","description":"Everyone at the Table is a series that explores everyday topics from the perspective of people... with different perspectives!\n\n[Learn more about the team](https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/people/ \"Learn More About the Team\").

But what does it mean to be delightfully accessible instead of hitting the benchmark of accessibility best practices?\n\nFurthermore, how can we better incorporate accessibility into the design process and enable those with visual impairments to provide feedback earlier? Today, visually impaired users can only provide feedback with a developed application that is compatible with a screen reader. By that time, many changes would require code refactoring, which would increase company expenses and delay improvements. Excluding valuable input from vision impaired users, a group of almost 300 million people, due to technical limitations is unacceptable and can be mitigated by the process we have developed through Design Thinking.","tags":["Design Thinking","Design"],"title":"Designing for Accessibility with Accessibility in Mind","id":"2rWUoVLVGU9CDgyydp5RVS","videoId":"67eaddf71668683e5f856793debee904"},{"start":"2020-09-15T18:00:00.000Z","description":"Nick Sullivan, Head of Research, interviews heavyweights in computer science research in areas such as Cryptography, Artificial Intelligence, Databases, and more.\n\nThis week's guest: Scott Aaronson","tags":["Interviews"],"title":"Master of (Computer) Science","id":"7AOfNzOHBeObiFt5X63WRq","videoId":"4cb614ad73cfda96b517c9fe42778ba4"},{"start":"2020-09-15T19:00:00.000Z","description":"Tune in for an overview of the 2 most common DNS setup options and why a customer might choose one over the other.","tags":["Tutorials","DNS"],"title":"CNAME Setup or Full Setup: The How and the Why","id":"5rZ5PqlDNWLf2xOdtBZeqU","videoId":"96941b81bbe796ccac18de7921ff943f"},{"start":"2020-09-15T20:00:00.000Z","description":"Join Chris de la Garza, Solutions Engineer, for a roundtable discussion where he interviews several Cloudflare employees about how they got into the tech industry.

These hardware boxes are expensive, hard to manage, and slow. And as now more than ever, the Internet is mission-critical to stay connected, we're also seeing a growing risk of cyber threats. So how do we ensure enterprise networks are safe and fast in a cost-effective manner?\n\nJoin this session to learn about Cloudflare's offering for networks—how Cloudflare can help enterprise networks be fast, secure, and reliable.","tags":["Security"],"title":"Replace your on-prem hardware DDoS appliance — Now!","id":"23QPbqKHvCXnhCj21F8EmV","videoId":"8ef9d81e3188a6a7d81c3082530a5472"},{"start":"2020-10-18T04:30:00.000Z","description":"__Best of: Cloudflare Connect 2019__\n\nThis session focuses on two exciting technologies you should know more about: Rust and WebAssembly. \n\n\n","title":"Rust & WebAssembly","id":"Y8jyXrXVzdsFsxhIPRNQG","videoId":"b7398275d22803cfb32a7e66ef3dcc07"},{"start":"2020-10-18T05:30:00.000Z","description":"The Creative Corner explores the experiences of creative professionals working within the tech industry.

But what does it mean to be delightfully accessible instead of hitting the benchmark of accessibility best practices?\n\nFurthermore, how can we better incorporate accessibility into the design process and enable those with visual impairments to provide feedback earlier? Today, visually impaired users can only provide feedback with a developed application that is compatible with a screen reader. By that time, many changes would require code refactoring, which would increase company expenses and delay improvements. Excluding valuable input from vision impaired users, a group of almost 300 million people, due to technical limitations is unacceptable and can be mitigated by the process we have developed through Design Thinking.","tags":["Design Thinking","Design"],"title":"Designing for Accessibility with Accessibility in Mind","id":"63lcshSKaTBtLBNCnvFjyS","videoId":"67eaddf71668683e5f856793debee904"},{"start":"2020-10-19T11:30:00.000Z","description":"2020 marks Cloudflare’s 10th birthday.
